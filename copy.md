<!-- Animals on Coins -->

Since Australia is known for its unique and diverse wildlife, it's no surprise that many of these beloved animals have found their way onto the country's coins. From the iconic kangaroo to the lesser-known numbat, Australian coins feature a wide range of native animals, making them not just currency but also a showcase of the country's unique flora and fauna. Each animal has its own story and symbolism, with many representing the country's spirit and identity. In this section, we'll explore some of the animals that have appeared on Australian coins and what makes them unique.


Echidna

Echidnas are one of the most unique animals found in Australia. They are one of only two egg-laying mammals in the world, the other being the platypus. Echidnas are also known as spiny anteaters because of the spines that cover their backs. These spines act as a defense mechanism, and echidnas can curl up into a ball to protect themselves from predators. They use their long snouts to find ants, termites, and other insects to eat, and their sticky tongues can dart in and out up to 100 times per minute. Echidnas are also excellent diggers and can dig themselves a burrow in just a few hours.


Lyrebird

Lyrebirds are known for their incredible mimicry skills. They can imitate a wide range of sounds, including other bird calls, human speech, and even the sound of cameras or chainsaws. Male lyrebirds are also known for their impressive courtship displays, where they spread their tail feathers into a lyre shape and dance around their territory to attract a mate. Female lyrebirds are responsible for raising their young, which they do alone. The chicks hatch from eggs and stay in the nest for several months before leaving and becoming independent.


Platypus

Platypuses are another unique Australian animal. They are one of only two egg-laying mammals in the world and have a duck-like bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail. They use their bill to find small aquatic animals to eat, such as insects, crustaceans, and small fish. Male platypuses have venomous spurs on their hind legs, which they use to fight with other males during breeding season. Platypuses are also excellent swimmers and can close their ears and nostrils to dive underwater for several minutes.


Emu

Emus are the second-largest bird in the world after the ostrich and are native to Australia. They have powerful legs and can run at speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. Emus are also great swimmers and can cross rivers and lakes. Female emus lay large green eggs that weigh up to 1 pound each, and males are responsible for incubating the eggs and raising the chicks. Emus are omnivorous and eat a variety of plants and animals, including insects, fruits, and small vertebrates. They have been known to travel long distances in search of food and water during times of drought.


Kangaroo

Kangaroos are marsupials found only in Australia. They are known for their powerful hind legs and their ability to hop, which allows them to move quickly and efficiently across the open plains of Australia. Some species of kangaroos can jump up to three times their own body length. Kangaroos are herbivores and eat a variety of plants, including grasses, leaves, and fruits. Baby kangaroos, called joeys, are born after only 33-38 days of gestation and are born very small and undeveloped. They immediately crawl into their mother's pouch, where they continue to develop for several months before becoming fully independent. Kangaroos are also known for their unique reproductive system, where females can have two different embryos at different stages of development.


King Charles III

An invasive species to Australia, King Charles III is known for his distinctive bushy eyebrows and his regal bearing. Although slow and slovenly, he is secretly a skilled mimic, able to imitate the calls of other animals and even the sounds of human speech.

While he may appear comfortable in his surroundings, experts within the scientific community are calling for his removal and relocation to a more suitable environment, as his continued presence in Australia could have serious consequences for the delicate balance of the ecosystem.

Despite the controversy surrounding his presence, some locals have taken a liking to King Charles III and have even begun to adopt him as a beloved mascot. Only time will tell what the future holds for this curious and controversial creature.
